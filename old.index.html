      <h1>About Me / Interests</h1>
      <div class="blurb"><p>In 2017 I graduated from Appalachian State University, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Philosophy.</p></div>
      <div class="blurb"><p>I recently completed a Code Immersion program through Tech Talent South, which helped me learn programming fundamentals as well as the ruby on rails framework.</p></div>
      <!-- <div class="blurb"><h4>Mountain Biking</h4><p>I have a (very amateur) interest in mountain biking.</div> -->
	    <div class="blurb"><h4>Linux</h4><p>Probably my nerdiest hobby at the moment is playing around with linux based operating systems. I love testing out and getting acquainted with the different distributions, trying out different package managers, and seeing just how much I can customize my system before breaking things. My go-to system at the moment is Arch Linux.</p></div>
	    <!-- <div class="blurb"><h4>Read Books</h4><p>I read a lot in my spare time, mostly history and philosophy, but some fiction as well.</p></div> -->

          <h1>Experience</h1>
          <div class="blurb">
	           <h5><b>Programming</b></h5>
             <p>My programming/computer experience so far is amateur</p>
	           <p>My tinking with linux, as well as the CLI work while learning prgramming with Tech Talent south, has made me confident in my abilities regarding the ins and outs of programs, operating systems, and their filesystems.</p>
	           <p>While taking the code immersion course with Tech Talent South, I developed several ruby on rails applications with are posted on my Github page.</p>
	           <p>Studying philosophy in college helped me flex my critical thinking skills, and I believe my study of formal logic serves me tremendously well while I continue to study programming.</p>
	           <h5><b>Other Work Experience</b></h5>
	           <p>The first job I had was started in high school. I was a maintenance worker for a local business in Charlotte, Golden B Enterprizes, which owned and managed numerous restaurants in Charlotte and throughout North and South Carolina. I was responsible for performing various jobs at all of the different locations. I continued this job during the summers in between my college semesters.</p>
	           <p>After graduating from college and having no idea what I wanted to do, I started working at Chipotle to keep some money coming in. It wasn't my favorite job in the world, but it was an overall good experience.</p>
